# Professional React Portfolio
During my bootcamp I created 3 portfolios and each time I learned new skills and continued to take it to the next level. 

I wanted to update my portfolio once more and make it more professional looking. With the help of an online [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-Cr00UYokU ) I was able to change sections and customize it. Thank you to Egator for putting out a great content, I learned a lot of new CSS techniques.
